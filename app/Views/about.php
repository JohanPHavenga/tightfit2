            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Tight Fit Garage Doors</b> was established in August 2008. We have served the Overberg ever since 
                with quality workmanship, honest value and peace of mind.<br>
                As an owner run business we have our ear on the pulse of our customers, often providing custom access 
                control solutions to suit their needs.</p>
            <p>
                We have expanded with the acquisition of both EAC and Carter Fencing in recent times.
                These business&apos; services were incorporated in the offerings of Tight Fit.</p>
            <p>
                In addition to <b>garage doors and gate automation</b> we now offer a turn key solution to industrial 
                and residential complexes, covering all aspects of access control, electronic and physical. From CCTV 
                and biometric scanners to turnstiles and traffic barriers.</p>
            <p>
                We embrace the use of the latest technologies and have a firm resolve to upskill our staff constantly. 
                Investment in our staff family is one of our core values.<br>
                We believe in educating our clients rather than making quick buck. To create a lasting relationship with our
                customers is an important part of our business and a key marketing strategy. Word of mouth and social media 
                are the most powerful marketing tools, driven by satisfied customers.</p>
            <p>
                We have partnered with innovative companies to bring you the best value possible, often cutting out 
                the middle man. Building personal relationships with our suppliers is important to us, allowing great 
                after-sales service.</p>
